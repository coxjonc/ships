Warships in the Royal Navy
---

I'm currently reading Patrick O'Brian's magnificent Aubrey-Maturin series, and wanted to graph the rise and fall of the man of war within the British fleet. Using data I scraped from [this site](http://www.pdavis.nl/MidVicShips.php?page=1), I filtered out all the ships with fewer than 5 guns, and plotted the resulting numbers of ships on a line graph. The data I used to plot this graph was collected by an enthusiast, not a professional, so take it with a grain of salt.
